************

Here is my paragraph, it has words  organized into a sentence. I am stringing *multiple sentences* **together** to form my paragraph. My last sentence contained some inline markup to bold a word, and to italicies some others.

This is my second paragraph. Below are a few formats of lists.

* This is the first item in a bulleted list
* This one is the second item of that bulleted list
  I  have a third line too, I think this will be part of the last bullet.

# This is a numbered list.
# Like this!
# I don't care what number each line gets, but i do want them to be in order.
# This could be good to avoid needing to re-number my list if i want to add a point before the end.

The Lists were neat, but now I am going to add a table. The Simple Table format looked more appealing to write, and read, not sure how it will render though.

=====  =====  =======
A      B      A and B
=====  =====  =======
False  False  False
True   False  False
False  True   False
True   True   True
=====  =====  =======
